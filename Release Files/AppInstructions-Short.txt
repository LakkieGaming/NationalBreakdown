Hello Reader,

		This application's goal is to create a national breakdown, or database containing
	information about a country. It can be split into hard-coded, and soft-coded.
	
		Soft-coded content are things that can change, e.g. DiplomaticFormat.txt,
	PresetList.cini, and SplashScreen.cini. The majority of these files are written in CINI
	configuration, which is a language created by Diego, which is a more complex version of
	Windows' .ini file format.
		
		Hard-coded content are the things that are not changed by the regular user, which are
	things like the complex menus, the main menu, the "manage" menu, and nation management
	menu.
	
		As development continues, we hope to see more soft-coded content to help make the
	software to the user's liking, if they have the knowledge to change it.
