*This file contains contents about how this application internally runs

Hello Reader,

		This is an application to manage national breakdowns and statistics about nations. It is
	can be explained by breaking it down into 2 parts. The configuration, and hard-coded menus.
	
		The configurations are the things that can be changed without knowing how to code. It is
	currently expanding with the ability to soft-code menus, which is currently used for the opening
	credits. It includes documentation on how to write it, and should be able to be changed without
	much difficulty. They are expanding to try to move a large part of the software from code, to
	reading the configuration files to be able to modify and add content on a whim. It uses CINI
	configuration files, which is also designed by Diego. CINI configuration files can be modelled
	off of .ini Windows files, but with brackets to created nested sections. It also uses quotes
	to signify text, numbers without quotes to signify numbers, and "true" or "false" without the
	quotes to signify true/false or boolean values. It also supports indentation.
	
		Hard-coded menus are the ones that requires programming knowledge to change. Right now, they
	make up most of the menus and are the backbone of this application. These menus include all the
	necessary logic, and there is the "create new" menu, which is to create a new database. There is
	the "main" menu, which is to perform an action, and the "nation" menu to edit the nation's
	properties. There are also a few other minors. This also includes the logic behind reading the
	CINI configuration files.
	
		This attempts to create a good experience using Java's Swing library, coupled with OS-specific
	look and feel. This will try to help the user make the software fit in better in with the OS'
	software.
